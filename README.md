# üß† OCD Patient Demographic and Clinical Data Analysis

This project explores static visualizations from a dataset of patients diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The aim is to uncover patterns in demographics, clinical profiles, and psychiatric comorbidities using descriptive statistics and classic Python plotting libraries.

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset Columns

The dataset contains the following fields:

- `Patient ID`
- `Age`
- `Gender`
- `Ethnicity`
- `Marital Status`
- `Education Level`
- `OCD Diagnosis Date`
- `Duration of Symptoms (months)`
- `Previous Diagnoses`
- `Family History of OCD`
- `Obsession Type`
- `Compulsion Type`
- `Y-BOCS Score (Obsessions)`
- `Y-BOCS Score (Compulsions)`
- `Depression Diagnosis`
- `Anxiety Diagnosis`
- `Medications`

## üìä Visualizations Created

- **Demographic Distributions**
  - Age histogram
  - Gender and Ethnicity bar charts
  - Marital and Education status breakdowns

- **Clinical Features**
  - Symptom duration histograms
  - Obsession & compulsion type frequency plots
  - Y-BOCS score distributions (Obsessions and Compulsions)

- **Psychiatric Comorbidities**
  - Depression and anxiety diagnosis frequencies
  - Combinations of previous diagnoses (if applicable)

## üß∞ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

The project focuses on local, private analysis for learning and insight generation.

## üîç Goal

To better understand how OCD presents across different patient profiles and how it coexists with other psychiatric factors using clean, interpretable visualizations.
